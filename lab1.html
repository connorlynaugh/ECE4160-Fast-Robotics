							<header>
								<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								In this lab, we first set up the SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano, working on its integration
								with the Arduino IDE and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication capabilities.
							</p>

							<h4 id="blink">Prelab 1A</h4>
							<p>
								For the prelab, I set up the Arduino IDE to specifically recognize and integrate with the 
								Sparkfun Appollo3 boards, including the Redboard Artemis Nano. An issue I experienced when 
								attempting serial communication was that my bootloader was unable to connect as a Macbook Pro
								user. This issue was resolved by following the provided instructions to update the CH340 Driver.
								Upon updating the upload settings and updating the SVL bootloader software everything was working.
							</p>

							<h4 id="blink">Blink</h4>
							<p>
								I started with the example “Blink” program to confirm that I could successfully program
								the board and control the on-board LED.

							<h4 id="serial">Serial</h4>
							<p>
								After verifying basic programming functionality, I used the “Serial” example to test data
								communication between the board and a serial monitor, ensuring that input data was correctly
								echoed back. 115200 was the correct baud rate for me to communicate.

							<h4 id="temperature">Temperature</h4>
							<p>
								The “Analog Read” example demonstrated that sensor data, specifically from the temperature
								sensor, could be collected. This takes full advantage of the on chip analog to digital converter. 
								If the chip was help the temperature was seen increasing over time.

								The “Microphone” example showed how I could access and process microphone data
								for frequency analysis. Upon speaking or whistling, higher frequency content was recorded.

							<h4 id="prelab">Prelab</h4>
							<p>
								In this section, I focused on establishing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication with the Artemis
								board using the ArduinoBLE library. I interfaced with it using Python via the bleak module, which required
								setting up a virtual environment and installing the necessary packages. In order to begin this lab I first had to install
								python and the necessary packages to start a virtual environment from my laptop. I then unzipped the provided source code and 
								organized it locally onto my desktop. I then became familiar with the codebase using the linked Jupyter Notebook.
							</p>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/Mac.png" alt="Mac Address example screenshot" />
							</span>

							<p>
								To enable BLE communication, I first identified the board’s unique MAC Address using the ble_arduino.ino sketch.
								This MAC Address was then updated in connections.yaml to establish a proper connection.
							</p>

							

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/connections.png" alt="connections.yaml update" />
							</span>

							<p>
								Additionally, I generated a UUID for the Bluetooth service using Python:
								#define BLE_UUID_TEST_SERVICE "772587a5-ad3b-4905-a21a-ee5d1d3ee220"
							</p>

							<p>
								After updating both connections.yaml and ble_arduino.ino, I was able to establish a BLE connection using helper
								functions provided by the course libraries. I had a lot of issues in this part and had to double check my python
								installations. Then I realized my bluetooth was not on :/. That solved my issues.

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/Hello.png" alt="HiHello" />
							</span>

							<h4 id="echo">1. Echo</h4>
							<p>
								The ECHO command receives a string from the Python Juypter Notebook, modifies it, and returns the altered string. The modified string
								is also printed via serial output and adds additional text to the provided string.
							</p>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/send3Arduino.png" alt="Send 3 Float Arduino" />
							</span>

							<span class="image fit">

							</span>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/send3Results.png" alt="Send 3 Float Results" />
							</span>

							<h4 id="send-three-floats">2. Send Three Floats</h4>
							<p>
								The SEND_THREE_FLOATS command functions similarly to ECHO, but it processes three float arguments instead of a single
								string. The code I wrote was based on and partially copied from the example command SEND_TWO_INTS.
							</p>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/GetTimeArduino.png" alt="Get Time Arduino" />
							</span>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/GetTimePython.png" alt="Get Time Python" />
							</span>

							<h4 id="get-time-millis">3. Get Time Millis</h4>
							<p>
								The GET_TIME_MILLIS command returns the current time in the format T:123456, obtained using the millis() function which 
								requires casting to append to the RX string. Otherwise it returns a long unsigned int.
							</p>

							</span>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/UpdatedTimeHandler.png" alt="UpdatedTimeHandler.png" />
							</span>

							<h4 id="notification-handler">4. Notification Handler</h4>
							<p>
								To parse the data being sent appropriately (and also follow lab instructions), I implemented a notification handler.
								I originally wrote much more complicated code, but then revised it after adding steps 6 and 7 to be a little more simpler.
							</p>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/TimeLoopArduino.png" alt="TimeLoop.png" />
							</span>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/TimeLoopPython.png" alt="TimeLoop.png" />
							</span>

							<h4 id="time-loop">5. TIME_LOOP</h4>
							<p>
								The TIME_LOOP repeatedly records the current time for a period of 5 seconds. 
								This is used to measure the amount of messages that can be sent from the artemis nano to my computer in a given time frame.
							</p>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/SendTimeDataArduino.png" alt="SendTimeDataArduino.png" />
							</span>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/SendTimeDataPython.png" alt="SendTimeDataPython.png" />
							</span>

							<h4 id="send-time-data">6. SEND_TIME_DATA</h4>
							<p>
								I then wrote a command SEND_TIME_DATA that sent the time data back.
							</p>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/GetTempArduino.png" alt="GetTempArduino.png" />
							</span>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/GetTempPython.png" alt="GetTempPython.png" />
							</span>

							<span class="image fit">
								<img src="images/lab1/GetTempOutput.png" alt="GetTempOutput.png" />
							</span>

							<h4 id="get-temp-readings">7. GET_TEMP_READINGS</h4>
							<p>
								I wrote GET_TEMP_READINGS that records both time and temperature and can be easily parsed.
								My notification handler broke when I added SEND_TEMP_DATA and GET_TEMP_READINGS, so I went back to reevaluate it as it
								was repeating weirdly. While I never figured out exactly what it was, I simplified it and redid it to print general statements.
							</p>

							<h4 id="lab-question">8. Lab Question</h4>
							<p>
								I have two methods to collect and store data: incrementally using GET_TIME_MILLIS or in batches with the note and send
								data commands. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. Using GET_TIME_MILLIS introduces significant delays
								between readings due to BLE communication, whereas recording data in batches runs in a loop on the Artemis, bypassing BLE
								latency and allowing for much faster iterations.
							</p>
							<p>
								With GET_TIME_MILLIS, I receive immediate feedback from sensors, which can be useful for debugging, while recording data
								in batches and sending it later introduces a delay between the initial request and data reception. In terms of storage,
								GET_TIME_MILLIS requires minimal, temporary storage to collect and send data immediately, but batch storage necessitates
								storing all data first, demanding significantly more memory.
							</p>
							<p>
								The approximate upper limit is 384kB of RAM; if I store only time (4B per reading), I can record up to 98,304 readings,
								while storing both time and temperature cuts this to 49,152 readings. If storage becomes a limitation, I may need to repeat
								batch recordings by overwriting previous data or reduce the sampling frequency to extend the data collection period.

							<p>
								Communication is crucial in order to figure out what is happening. This lab seemed to be focused on getting settled with
								the board and establishing communication with it. I struggled with getting set up only to realize that my bluetooth was not on.
								It also took me embarrassingly long to realize that I did not update my commands properly.

								Thanks to all the staff and the professor for helping in lab. I referenced the webpages of past students: Mikayla Lahr,
								Nidhi Sonwalkar, Kofi Ohene Adu, Minh Nguyen, and Daria Kot. I also had ChatGPT proof read this webpage and shorten my
								writing in areas where I was too wordy. Shout out to Aidan McNay for sitting with me and teaching me about Sphinx and
								helping me build a test repo for this class (before I publish to this actual page).
